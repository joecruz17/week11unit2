    <li>What is Express in Node.js and why is it used?
        Express is web app framework for node.js. It allows you to handle routing, middleware, request and response handling.
    </li>
    <li>How does Mongoose help in using MongoDB with Node.js?
        Mongoose is an Object Data Mapping library that allows you to interact with MongoDb simply. It provides a schema to help with  CRUD, and defining relationships
    </li>
    <li>Can you explain the role of Mongoose in managing relationships between data? Mongoose allows you to define relationships through the schema. 
    </li>
    <li>What is a software design pattern? Give an example. It is a reusable solution to common problems. The singleton pattern is when you use one instance of a class the entire application.
    </li>
    <li>Can you explain the MVC architecture in detail?
        It contains Models, Views, Controllers
    </li>
    <li>What roles do Model, View, and Controller play in the MVC architecture?
        Models, contains the apps data structures and database interactions and managing the app state.
        Views, presents the data to the user, as well as a visual representation. 
        Controllers, acts as a middleman for the models and views. It receives the users actions, and translates it to be performed on the models or views. It updates the Models, and sends it to view to present. 
    </li>
    <li>Define Latency and Throughput in the context of APIs.
        Latency is the time delay for the request to travel from the client to the server and back. Throughput is the measure of how many requests can be processed by the API within a time period.
    </li>
    <li>Why is it important to minimize latency and maximize throughput in APIs? It helps improve the user experience, works better with other systems, utilizes resources effeciently
    </li>
    <li>What is Authentication in terms of web development? Thre is user identification, credential verification and authethentication result.
    </li>
    <li>How does the authorization process start? it starts after the user has been authenticated , then the sysmte indentifies the user and assigns an authentication token or session identifier to check the state. 
    </li>
    <li>What is express.staticused for in Express? It is the middleware that uses static files such as HTML, CSS and JS. It retrieves the static file and response handling. </li>
    <li>Can you give an example of serving static files using express.static? app.use(express.static('public')) this accesses the public directory and uses the static images. 
    </li>
    <li> What is Jest and why is it used? Jest is a testing framework that tests JS, Node.js applications. 
    </li>
    <li>How can Supertest be helpful when working with Jest? It simulates HTTP requests to your server. It uspports aysynchronous testing. 
    </li>
    <li>Can you describe how manual and automated tests are executed? Manual tests involves a person manually testing , while automated testing involves the use of automated tools.
    </li>
    <li>What is the difference between unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing? Unit testing foces on testing individual units of code, intergation testing involves testing the interactions between multiple components of a system, end-to end tests evaluate the behavior of a complete softare system from start to finsh. 
    </li>
    <li>Can you provide examples of functional, regression, smoke, and performance tests? funcitonal testing includes testing the add to cart function on websites. Regression testing example would be after implementing a code, testing if the previous functions still work. Smoke testing is checking if main functionalities are working. Performance testing is testing the reponse time and stability during peak usage. 

    </li>
    <li>What is meant by positive testing and negative testing in a functional testing context? Positive testing is
